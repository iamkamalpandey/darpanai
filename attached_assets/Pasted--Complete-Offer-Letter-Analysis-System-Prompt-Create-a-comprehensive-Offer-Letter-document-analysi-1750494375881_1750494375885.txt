# Complete Offer Letter Analysis System Prompt

Create a comprehensive Offer Letter document analysis system with the following specifications:

## CORE FUNCTIONALITY
Build an AI-powered Offer Letter analysis system that processes university offer letter documents and provides detailed strategic insights, institutional research, scholarship opportunities, and comparative analysis for international students. The system should handle PDF uploads, extract text content, generate structured analysis reports, and perform real-time web scraping for institutional data.

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, using shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Express.js with PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM
- **File Processing**: multer for uploads, pdf-parse for text extraction
- **AI Integration**: Multi-model approach using OpenAI GPT-4o and Claude Anthropic for specialized analysis tasks
- **Web Scraping**: Puppeteer/Playwright for institutional data collection
- **Authentication**: Session-based auth with user quota management
- **Caching**: Redis for institutional data and scholarship information

## DATABASE SCHEMA
Create `offer_letter_analyses` table with:
- id (primary key)
- userId (foreign key to users table)
- fileName (original document name)
- fileSize (document size in bytes)
- documentText (extracted text content)
- analysisResults (JSONB containing structured analysis)
- gptAnalysisResults (JSONB containing OpenAI GPT analysis)
- claudeAnalysisResults (JSONB containing Claude Anthropic analysis)
- hybridAnalysisResults (JSONB containing combined AI insights)
- institutionalData (JSONB containing scraped institutional information)
- scholarshipData (JSONB containing available scholarships)
- competitorAnalysis (JSONB containing similar institutions data)
- tokensUsed (OpenAI API usage tracking)
- claudeTokensUsed (Claude API usage tracking)
- totalAiCost (combined AI processing cost)
- processingTime (analysis duration in seconds)
- scrapingTime (web scraping duration in seconds)
- isPublic (boolean for admin visibility)
- createdAt (timestamp)

## ANALYSIS STRUCTURE
