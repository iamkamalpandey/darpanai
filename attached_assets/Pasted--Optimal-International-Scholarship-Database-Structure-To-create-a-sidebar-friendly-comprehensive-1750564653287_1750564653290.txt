## Optimal International Scholarship Database Structure

To create a sidebar-friendly, comprehensive, and non-redundant structure for international scholarships—including type (Government, Private, Institution, Other) and country—a unified, normalized table is proposed below. This merges best practices from research and your sample data, ensuring scalability, clarity, and completeness for a global scholarship directory[1][2].
